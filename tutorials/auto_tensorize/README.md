## Current State
Currently these tutorial files are mainly
for test purpose. We use these files to get
ourselves familiar with tensorize and tensorcore.

### Different Files:
#### 1. Test capsule compile:
- opt_conv_tensorcore.py
#### 2. Try convolution with tensorcore with different layout
- conv2d_tensorcore.py
#### 3. Other exploration
- conv2d_nchw_tensorcore_transform.py
#### 4. Performance test
- autotvm_conv2d_tensorcore_nchw.py
- conv2d_implicit_gemm_tensorcore.py
